.TH SULOGIN "8" "Jul 2012" "util-linux" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
sulogin \- Single-user login
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sulogin
.RB [ options ]
.RB [ tty ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sulogin
is invoked by
.B init
when the system goes into single user mode.
.PP
The user is prompted:
.IP "" .5i
Give root password for system maintenance
.br
(or type Control\-D for normal startup):
.PP
.I sulogin
will be connected to the current terminal, or to the optional tty device that
can be specified on the command line (typically
.BR /dev/console ).
.PP
After the user exits the single-user shell or presses control\-D at the
prompt, the system will continue to boot.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-force\fP"
If the default method of obtaining the root password via
.BR getpwnam (3)
from the system fails, manually examine
.I /etc/passwd
and
.I /etc/shadow
to get the password.  If they are damaged or nonexistent, sulogin will start
a root shell without asking for a password.
.IP
Only use the
.B \-e
option if you are sure the console is physically protected against
unauthorized access.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-login\-shell\fP"
Specifying this option causes sulogin to start the shell process as a login
shell.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timeout \fIseconds\fP"
Specify the maximum amount of time to wait for user input.  By default,
sulogin will wait forever.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fP"
Display help text and exit.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fP"
Display version information and exit.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.I sulogin
looks for the environment variable
.B SUSHELL
or
.B sushell
to determine what shell to start.  If the environment variable is not set, it
will try to execute root's shell from
.IR /etc/passwd .
If that fails it
will fall back to
.IR /bin/sh .
