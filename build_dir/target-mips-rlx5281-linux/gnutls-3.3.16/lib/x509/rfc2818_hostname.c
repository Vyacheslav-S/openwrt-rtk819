 *
 * IPv4 addresses are accepted by this function in the dotted-decimal
 * format (e.g, ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd), and IPv6 addresses in the hexadecimal
 * x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x format. For them the IPAddress subject alternative
 * name extension is consulted, as well as the DNSNames in case of a non-match.
 * The latter fallback exists due to misconfiguration of many servers
 * which place an IPAddress inside the DNSName extension.
 *
 * The comparison of dns names may have false-negatives as it is done byte 
 * by byte in non-ascii names.
 *
 * When the flag %GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_WILDCARDS is specified no
 * wildcards are considered. Otherwise they are only considered if the
 * domain name consists of three components or more, and the wildcard
 * starts at the leftmost position.
