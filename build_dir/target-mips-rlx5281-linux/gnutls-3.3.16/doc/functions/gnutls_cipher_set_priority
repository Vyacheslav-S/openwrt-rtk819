@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_cipher_set_priority} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, const int * @var{list})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

@var{list}: is a 0 terminated list of gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t elements.

Sets the priority on the ciphers supported by gnutls.  Priority is
higher for elements specified before others.  After specifying the
ciphers you want, you must append a 0.  Note that the priority is
set on the client. The server does not use the algorithm's
priority except for disabling algorithms that were not specified.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) on success, or a negative error code.
