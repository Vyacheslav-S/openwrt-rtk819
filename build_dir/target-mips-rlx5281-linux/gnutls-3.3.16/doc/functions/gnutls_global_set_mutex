@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_global_set_mutex} (mutex_init_func @var{init}, mutex_deinit_func @var{deinit}, mutex_lock_func @var{lock}, mutex_unlock_func @var{unlock})
@var{init}: mutex initialization function

@var{deinit}: mutex deinitialization function

@var{lock}: mutex locking function

@var{unlock}: mutex unlocking function

With this function you are allowed to override the default mutex
locks used in some parts of gnutls and dependent libraries. This function
should be used if you have complete control of your program and libraries.
Do not call this function from a library, or preferrably from any application
unless really needed to. GnuTLS will use the appropriate locks for the running
system.

This function must be called prior to any other gnutls function.
