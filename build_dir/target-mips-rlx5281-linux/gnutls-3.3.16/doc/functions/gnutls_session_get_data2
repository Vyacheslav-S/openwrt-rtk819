@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_session_get_data2} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, gnutls_datum_t * @var{data})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

@var{data}: is a pointer to a datum that will hold the session.

Returns all session parameters needed to be stored to support resumption.
The client should call this, and store the returned session data. A session
may be resumed later by calling @code{gnutls_session_set_data()} .  
This function must be called after a successful (full) handshake. It should
not be used in resumed sessions --see @code{gnutls_session_is_resumed()} .

The returned  @code{data} are allocated and must be released using @code{gnutls_free()} .

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
