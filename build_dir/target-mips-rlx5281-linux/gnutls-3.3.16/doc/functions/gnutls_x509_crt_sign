@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_sign} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{crt}, gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{issuer}, gnutls_x509_privkey_t @var{issuer_key})
@var{crt}: a certificate of type @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t} 

@var{issuer}: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

@var{issuer_key}: holds the issuer's private key

This function is the same a @code{gnutls_x509_crt_sign2()}  with no flags,
and SHA1 as the hash algorithm.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
