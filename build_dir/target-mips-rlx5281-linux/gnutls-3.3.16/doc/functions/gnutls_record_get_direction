@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_record_get_direction} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

This function provides information about the internals of the
record protocol and is only useful if a prior gnutls function call
(e.g.  @code{gnutls_handshake()} ) was interrupted for some reason, that
is, if a function returned @code{GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED}  or
@code{GNUTLS_E_AGAIN} .  In such a case, you might want to call @code{select()} 
or @code{poll()}  before calling the interrupted gnutls function again.  To
tell you whether a file descriptor should be selected for either
reading or writing, @code{gnutls_record_get_direction()}  returns 0 if the
interrupted function was trying to read data, and 1 if it was
trying to write data.

This function's output is unreliable if you are using the
 @code{session} in different threads, for sending and receiving.

@strong{Returns:} 0 if trying to read data, 1 if trying to write data.
