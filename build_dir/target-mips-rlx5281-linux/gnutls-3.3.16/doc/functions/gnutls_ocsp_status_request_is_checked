Check whether an OCSP status response was included in the handshake
and whether it was checked and valid (not too old or superseded). 
This is a helper function when needing to decide whether to perform an
OCSP validity check on the peer's certificate. Must be called after
@code{gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3()}  is called.

@strong{Returns:} non zero it was valid, or a zero if it wasn't sent,
or sent and was invalid.
