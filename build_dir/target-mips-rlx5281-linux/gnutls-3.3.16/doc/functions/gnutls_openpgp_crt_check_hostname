@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_openpgp_crt_check_hostname} (gnutls_openpgp_crt_t @var{key}, const char * @var{hostname})
@var{key}: should contain a @code{gnutls_openpgp_crt_t}  structure

@var{hostname}: A null terminated string that contains a DNS name

This function will check if the given key's owner matches the
given hostname. This is a basic implementation of the matching
described in RFC2818 (HTTPS), which takes into account wildcards.

@strong{Returns:} non-zero for a successful match, and zero on failure.
