@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_openpgp_send_cert} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, gnutls_openpgp_crt_status_t @var{status})
@var{session}: is a pointer to a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

@var{status}: is one of GNUTLS_OPENPGP_CERT, or GNUTLS_OPENPGP_CERT_FINGERPRINT

This function will order gnutls to send the key fingerprint
instead of the key in the initial handshake procedure. This should
be used with care and only when there is indication or knowledge
that the server can obtain the client's key.
