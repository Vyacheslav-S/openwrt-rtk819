@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_set_default_export_priority} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

Sets some default priority on the ciphers, key exchange methods, macs
and compression methods.  This function also includes weak algorithms.

This is the same as calling:

gnutls_priority_set_direct (session, "EXPORT", NULL);

This function is kept around for backwards compatibility, but
because of its wide use it is still fully supported.  If you wish
to allow users to provide a string that specify which ciphers to
use (which is recommended), you should use
@code{gnutls_priority_set_direct()}  or @code{gnutls_priority_set()}  instead.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  on success, or an error code.
