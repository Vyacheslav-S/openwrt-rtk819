@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_dh_params_generate2} (gnutls_dh_params_t @var{dparams}, unsigned int @var{bits})
@var{dparams}: Is the structure that the DH parameters will be stored

@var{bits}: is the prime's number of bits

This function will generate a new pair of prime and generator for use in
the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The new parameters will be allocated using
@code{gnutls_malloc()}  and will be stored in the appropriate datum.
This function is normally slow.

Do not set the number of bits directly, use @code{gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits()}  to
get bits for @code{GNUTLS_PK_DSA} .
Also note that the DH parameters are only useful to servers.
Since clients use the parameters sent by the server, it's of
no use to call this in client side.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.
