@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_mem} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t         @var{c}, const uint8_t * @var{data}, size_t @var{dlen}, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t @var{format})
@var{c}: A certificate credentials structure

@var{data}: buffer with keyring data.

@var{dlen}: length of data buffer.

@var{format}: the format of the keyring

The function is used to set keyrings that will be used internally
by various OpenPGP functions. For example to find a key when it
is needed for an operations. The keyring will also be used at the
verification functions.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
