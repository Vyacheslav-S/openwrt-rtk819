@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_handshake_set_max_packet_length} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, size_t @var{max})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

@var{max}: is the maximum number.

This function will set the maximum size of all handshake messages.
Handshakes over this size are rejected with
@code{GNUTLS_E_HANDSHAKE_TOO_LARGE}  error code.  The default value is
48kb which is typically large enough.  Set this to 0 if you do not
want to set an upper limit.

The reason for restricting the handshake message sizes are to
limit Denial of Service attacks.
