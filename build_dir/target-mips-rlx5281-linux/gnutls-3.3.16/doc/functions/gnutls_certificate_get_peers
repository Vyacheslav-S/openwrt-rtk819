@deftypefun {const gnutls_datum_t *} {gnutls_certificate_get_peers} (gnutls_session_t          @var{session}, unsigned int * @var{list_size})
@var{session}: is a gnutls session

@var{list_size}: is the length of the certificate list (may be @code{NULL} )

Get the peer's raw certificate (chain) as sent by the peer.  These
certificates are in raw format (DER encoded for X.509).  In case of
a X.509 then a certificate list may be present.  The first
certificate in the list is the peer's certificate, following the
issuer's certificate, then the issuer's issuer etc.

In case of OpenPGP keys a single key will be returned in raw
format.

@strong{Returns:} a pointer to a @code{gnutls_datum_t}  containing the peer's
certificates, or @code{NULL}  in case of an error or if no certificate
was used.
