@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_compression_set_priority} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, const int * @var{list})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

@var{list}: is a 0 terminated list of gnutls_compression_method_t elements.

Sets the priority on the compression algorithms supported by
gnutls.  Priority is higher for elements specified before others.
After specifying the algorithms you want, you must append a 0.
Note that the priority is set on the client. The server does not
use the algorithm's priority except for disabling algorithms that
were not specified.

TLS 1.0 does not define any compression algorithms except
NULL. Other compression algorithms are to be considered as gnutls
extensions.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  on success, or an error code.
