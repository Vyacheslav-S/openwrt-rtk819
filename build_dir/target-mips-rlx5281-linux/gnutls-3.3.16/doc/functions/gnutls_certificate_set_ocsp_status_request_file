@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{sc}, const char * @var{response_file}, unsigned int @var{flags})
@var{sc}: is a credentials structure.

@var{response_file}: a filename of the OCSP response

@var{flags}: should be zero

This function sets the filename of an OCSP response, that will be
sent to the client if requests an OCSP certificate status. This is
a convenience function which is inefficient on busy servers since
the file is opened on every access. Use 
@code{gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_function()}  to fine-tune
file accesses.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.

@strong{Since:} 3.1.3
