@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_sign2} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{crt}, gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{issuer}, gnutls_x509_privkey_t @var{issuer_key}, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t @var{dig}, unsigned int @var{flags})
@var{crt}: a certificate of type @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t} 

@var{issuer}: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

@var{issuer_key}: holds the issuer's private key

@var{dig}: The message digest to use, @code{GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1}  is a safe choice

@var{flags}: must be 0

This function will sign the certificate with the issuer's private key, and
will copy the issuer's information into the certificate.

This must be the last step in a certificate generation since all
the previously set parameters are now signed.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
