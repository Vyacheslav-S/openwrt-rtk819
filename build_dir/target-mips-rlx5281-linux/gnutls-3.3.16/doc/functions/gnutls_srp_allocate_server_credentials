@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_srp_allocate_server_credentials} (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t *            @var{sc})
@var{sc}: is a pointer to a @code{gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t}  structure.

This structure is complex enough to manipulate directly thus this
helper function is provided in order to allocate it.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, or an
error code.
