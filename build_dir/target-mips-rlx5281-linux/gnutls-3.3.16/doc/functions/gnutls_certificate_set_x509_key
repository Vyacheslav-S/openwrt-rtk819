@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{res}, gnutls_x509_crt_t * @var{cert_list}, int @var{cert_list_size}, gnutls_x509_privkey_t @var{key})
@var{res}: is a @code{gnutls_certificate_credentials_t}  structure.

@var{cert_list}: contains a certificate list (path) for the specified private key

@var{cert_list_size}: holds the size of the certificate list

@var{key}: is a @code{gnutls_x509_privkey_t}  key

This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may be
called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
the server.  For clients that wants to send more than their own end
entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA cert) then put
the certificate chain in  @code{cert_list} .

Note that the certificates and keys provided, can be safely deinitialized
after this function is called.

If that function fails to load the  @code{res} structure is at an undefined state, it must
not be reused to load other keys or certificates.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) on success, or a negative error code.

@strong{Since:} 2.4.0
