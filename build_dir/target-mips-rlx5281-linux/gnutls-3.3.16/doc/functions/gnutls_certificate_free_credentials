@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_certificate_free_credentials} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{sc})
@var{sc}: is a @code{gnutls_certificate_credentials_t}  structure.

This structure is complex enough to manipulate directly thus this
helper function is provided in order to free (deallocate) it.

This function does not free any temporary parameters associated
with this structure (ie RSA and DH parameters are not freed by this
function).
