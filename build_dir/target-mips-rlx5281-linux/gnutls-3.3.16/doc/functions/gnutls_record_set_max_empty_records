@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_record_set_max_empty_records} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, const unsigned int @var{i})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  structure.

@var{i}: is the desired value of maximum empty records that can be accepted in a row.

Used to set the maximum number of empty fragments that can be accepted
in a row. Accepting many empty fragments is useful for receiving length-hidden
content, where empty fragments filled with pad are sent to hide the real
length of a message. However, a malicious peer could send empty fragments to
mount a DoS attack, so as a safety measure, a maximum number of empty fragments
is accepted by default. If you know your application must accept a given number
of empty fragments in a row, you can use this function to set the desired value.
