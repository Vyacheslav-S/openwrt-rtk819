@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{res}, gnutls_openpgp_crt_t @var{crt}, gnutls_openpgp_privkey_t @var{pkey})
@var{res}: is a @code{gnutls_certificate_credentials_t}  structure.

@var{crt}: contains an openpgp public key

@var{pkey}: is an openpgp private key

This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may be
called more than once (in case multiple keys/certificates exist
for the server).

Note that this function requires that the preferred key ids have
been set and be used. See @code{gnutls_openpgp_crt_set_preferred_key_id()} .
Otherwise the master key will be used.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.
