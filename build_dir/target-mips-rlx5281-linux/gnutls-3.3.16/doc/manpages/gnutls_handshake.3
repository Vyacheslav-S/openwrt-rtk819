.SH NAME
gnutls_handshake \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_handshake(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function does the handshake of the TLS/SSL protocol, and
initializes the TLS connection.

This function will fail if any problem is encountered, and will
return a negative error code. In case of a client, if the client
has asked to resume a session, but the server couldn't, then a
full handshake will be performed.

The non\-fatal errors expected by this function are:
\fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP, \fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP, 
\fBGNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED\fP, and \fBGNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA\fP,
the latter only in a case of rehandshake.

The former two interrupt the handshake procedure due to the lower
layer being interrupted, and the latter because of an alert that
may be sent by a server (it is always a good idea to check any
received alerts). On these errors call this function again, until it
returns 0; cf.  \fBgnutls_record_get_direction()\fP and
\fBgnutls_error_is_fatal()\fP. In DTLS sessions the non\-fatal error
\fBGNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET\fP is also possible, and indicates that
the MTU should be adjusted.

If this function is called by a server after a rehandshake request
then \fBGNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA\fP or
\fBGNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED\fP may be returned.  Note that these
are non fatal errors, only in the specific case of a rehandshake.
Their meaning is that the client rejected the rehandshake request or
in the case of \fBGNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA\fP it could also mean that
some data were pending.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise a negative error code.
