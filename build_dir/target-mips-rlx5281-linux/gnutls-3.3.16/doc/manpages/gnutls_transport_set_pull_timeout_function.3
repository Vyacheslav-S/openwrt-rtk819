.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "gnutls_pull_timeout_func func" 12
a callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to know
whether data are ready to be received. It should wait for data a
given time frame in milliseconds. The callback should return 0 on 
timeout, a positive number if data can be received, and \-1 on error.
You'll need to override this function if \fBselect()\fP is not suitable
for the provided transport calls.

As with \fBselect()\fP, if the timeout value is zero the callback should return
zero if no data are immediately available.

 \fIgnutls_pull_timeout_func\fP is of the form,
int (*gnutls_pull_timeout_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, unsigned int ms);
