.SH NAME

.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", const char * " hostname ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will check if the given certificate's subject matches
the given hostname.  This is a basic implementation of the matching
described in RFC6125, and takes into account wildcards,
and the DNSName/IPAddress subject alternative name PKIX extension.

IPv4 addresses are accepted by this function in the dotted\-decimal
format (e.g, ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd), and IPv6 addresses in the hexadecimal
x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x format. For them the IPAddress subject alternative
name extension is consulted, as well as the DNSNames in case of a non\-match.
The latter fallback exists due to misconfiguration of many servers
which place an IPAddress inside the DNSName extension.

The comparison of dns names may have false\-negatives as it is done byte 
by byte in non\-ascii names.

When the flag \fBGNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_WILDCARDS\fP is specified no
wildcards are considered. Otherwise they are only considered if the
domain name consists of three components or more, and the wildcard
starts at the leftmost position.
.SH "RETURNS"
non\-zero for a successful match, and zero on failure.
