 * The player thread controls the playback.  It acts as a bridge
 * between the decoder thread and the output thread(s): it receives
 * #music_chunk objects from the decoder, optionally mixes them
 * (cross-fading), applies software volume, and sends them to the
 * audio outputs via audio_output_all_play().
 *
 * It is controlled by the main thread (the playlist code), see
 * player_control.h.  The playlist enqueues new songs into the player
 * thread and sends it commands.
 *
 * The player thread itself does not do any I/O.  It synchronizes with
 * other threads via #GMutex and #GCond objects, and passes
 * #music_chunk instances around in #music_pipe objects.
