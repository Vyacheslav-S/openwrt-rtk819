pkg-config
----------

MPD uses pkg-config to locate most external libraries.  If you do not
have pkg-config, or if your version of the library does not ship the
".pc" file, you have to provide the library's build options in
environment variables.  These variables are documented in "./configure
--help".  Example:

 FLAC_CFLAGS=-I/usr/include/FLAC FLAC_LIBS=-lFLAC ./configure


Download
--------

Get the latest release from of MPD from <http://www.musicpd.org/>.

Compile
-------

1) unzip and untar the archive

$ tar zxvf mpd-x.x.x.tar.gz

or

$ tar jxvf mpd-x.x.x.tar.bz2

2) change to directory created

$ cd mpd-x.x.x

3) Run configure script (this will determine what dependencies you have)

$ ./configure

4) Compile

$ make

Install (Optional)
-------

(as root)
$ make install

Run
---

1) run mpd:

$ mpd <config file>

First default is ~/.mpdconf then ~/.mpd/mpd.conf then /etc/mpd.conf. If
neither of these exist a mpd configuration file must be specified at
runtime.

A sample config file is included with the source of MPD, mpdconf.example.

The first time MPD is run it will attempt to discover all music in your
music root, recursively. This can be affected by the symbolic link 
options specified in the example mpd.conf.

Using MPD
---------

You can download many different interfaces for MPD at 
	<http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients>

MPD can be interfaced directly using telnet (see COMMANDS, if you are brave).
