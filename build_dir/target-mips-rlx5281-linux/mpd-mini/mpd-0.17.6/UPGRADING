                       Music Player Daemon (MPD) - UPGRADING

Upgrading to 0.14
-----------------

The filesystem character set is determined by GLib, if it is not
configured.  GLib has an affinity towards UTF-8, while older MPD
versions used to choose ISO-Latin-1.


Upgrading to 0.13.0
-------------------

JACK, Avahi, and libsamplerate have been added as optional dependencies.
FLAC/OggFLAC now supports the 1.1.3 API, and libmikmod 3.2.0 betas are
supported as well.

New mpd.conf parameters include zeroconf_name, samplerate_converter, and
gapless_mp3_playback.  See the mpd.conf man page or updated mpconf.example for
more information on these parameters.

Support for the ID3v2 "Original Artist/Performer" tag has been added.  Your
MP3s will need to be rescanned for these tags to be included in the database.
This can be done by running mpd --create-db.

Upgrading to 0.12.0
-------------------

The ao_driver and ao_driver_options config parameters have been removed and
replaced with the audio_output config section.  You will have to update your
config file to use this instead.  See the mpd.conf man page or the new
mpdconf.example for details on specifying audio_output sections.

The db_file parameter is no longer optional.  If you did not specify it in your
old config file then you will have to add it in order to run 0.12.0.

Support for OggFLAC and Musepack audio files has been added.  Additionally,
scanning of MP3 files has been improved.  To make use of these updates it is
highly recommended that you run mpd --create-db to recreate your entire
database.

Upgrading to 0.11.0
-------------------

The database format has changed a little bit, but in a backward compatible way.
This means that if you upgrade to 0.11.0 from 0.10.x, you do not need to make
any changes.  However, if you downgrade back to 0.10.x, then you will need
to recreate your db.

The default port for MPD is now 6600, so update your mpd and client
configurations appropriately.

Upgrading to 0.10.0
-------------------

All information is now stored in the db in UTF-8 format, and the character
set used for the filesystem is stored in the db.  Thus, it is highly
recommended that you recreate the db.  To do so, run mpd with the 
"--create-db" command line option.  Also, note that the filesystem
character set will be determined from your current locale settings.
If your locale settings are not the same as those used for the filesystem,
then use the config file parameter "filesystem_charset" to specify the
correct character set (this maybe necessary if you create the db with root).

Upgrading to 0.9.3
------------------

Wave support was added, so to have your wave files added, update the db (mpc
update).  

Also, song lengths are now stored in the db.  To get this stuff
added to the db, you will need to recreate the db from scratch.  To do this,
run mpd with the "--create-db" commandline option. 

Upgrading to 0.9.0
------------------

The "stop_on_error" config parameter was removed, so be sure to remove this
parameter from your config file.

Upgrading to 0.8.x
------------------

If you have FLACs, then to have them added to your list of available music,
just use "update".

Upgrading from 0.5.x to 0.6.x
-----------------------------
If you have not compiled MPD with "make ogg", then nothing is needed.

If you compiled with "make ogg", just use "update" (available via the phpMp
interface) to add your OGGs to MPD's list of available music.
