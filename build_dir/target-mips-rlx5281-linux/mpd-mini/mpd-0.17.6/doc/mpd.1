.SH NAME
MPD \- A daemon for playing music
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mpd
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ CONF_FILE ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
MPD is a daemon for playing music.  Music is played through the configured
audio output(s) (which are generally local, but can be remote).  The daemon
stores info about all available music, and this info can be easily searched and
retrieved.  Player control, info retrieval, and playlist management can all be
managed remotely.

MPD searches for a config file in \fB~/.mpdconf\fP then \fB/etc/mpd.conf\fP or
uses CONF_FILE.
